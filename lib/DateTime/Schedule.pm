=head1 NAME

DateTime::Schedule - Determine scheduled days in range based on exclusions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use DateTime::Schedule;

  my $dts = DateTime::Schedule->new(exclude => [
    DateTime->new(year => 2024, month => 01, day => 01),
    DateTime->new(year => 2024, month => 07, day => 04),
    DateTime->new(year => 2024, month => 12, day => 25)
  ]);

  my $start = DateTime->new(year => 2024, month => 1, day => 1);
  my $end = DateTime->new(year => 2024, month => 12, day => 31);
  print $dts->days_in_range($start, $end)->count; # 363

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a simple class that allows you to find out which days are "scheduled"
between a start date and an end date. For instance, given the start date of a
school year, and the current date, and with all school holidays entered as 
L</exclude>d, this can tell you how many school days have elapsed in the year.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new

Default constructor. Returns a new L<DateTime::Schedule> instance.

Parameters:

=head4 portion

I<Optional>. Default C<1>.

A number between 0 and 1 indicating how much of a day must elapse to be
included/excluded at the boundaries of the range.

=head4 exclude

I<Optional>. Default C<[]>

An arrayref of L<DateTime>s. These days are exclusions to the normal schedule
(e.g., holidays). Any time-portion of the DateTimes is ignored.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 days_in_range($start, $end)

Given start/end L<DateTime>s, returns a L<DateTime::Set> of all the days which
are scheduled (i.e., not excluded)
