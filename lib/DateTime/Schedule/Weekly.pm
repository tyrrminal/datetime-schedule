=head1 NAME

DateTime::Schedule::Weekly - Determine scheduled days in range based on weekly recurrence and inclusions/exclusions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use DateTime::Schedule::Weekly;

  my $dts = DateTime::Schedule::Weekly->weekdays(exclude => [...list of school holidays...], portion => 0.5);

  my $school_days_elapsed = $dts->days_in_range($first_day_of_school, $now)->count;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This subclass of L<DateTime::Schedule> augments its capabilities to support a 
regular weekly schedule of on/off days.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new

Returns a new instance. Permits the following construction parameters, in 
addition to those supported by L<DateTime::Schedule>:

=head4 sunday, monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday

I<Optional>. Default C<true>

These seven constructor parameters indicate which days of the week are "scheduled"
By default, all are "on", making the behavior identical to L<DateTime::Schedule>'s.

=head4 include

I<Optional>. Default C<[]>

An arrayref of L<DateTime>s. These days are included over and above the normal
schedule.

E.g., a school schedule could be regularly M-F, but due to extensive weather-related
closures, the school added in one or more saturdays class days. These would be
C<include>d.

B<N.B. Exclusions have priority over inclusions, so a date in both lists will be excluded!>

=head2 weekdays

Identical to calling L</new> except that by default C<saturday> and C<sunday> are
"off".

=head2 weekends

Identical to calling L</new> except that by default C<monday>, C<tuesday>, 
C<wednesday>, C<thursday>, and C<friday> are "off".

=head1 METHODS

Implements all methods from L<DateTime::Schedule>

=head2 is_day_scheduled($datetime)

Given a L<DateTime>, returns false if date is in the exclusion list. Otherwise
returns true if date is in the inclusion list or if date is in a scheduled day
of week. Returns false otherwise.
